# AfriTokeni MVP

**SMS-Based Financial System on Internet Computer Protocol for Uganda**



AfriTokeni is an innovative SMS-based financial system built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) designed to provide accessible financial services to Uganda's underserved populations. By leveraging SMS technology and blockchain infrastructure, we're creating a solution that serves the **54% of adults who remain unbanked** while offering services **83% cheaper** than current mobile money solutions.

## üåç Project Overview

### The Opportunity
- **$133 billion** mobile money market growing at 25.73% annually
- **14.6 million unbanked adults** (54% of Uganda's population)
- **98% 2G coverage** with mature SMS infrastructure
- **84% feature phone dominance** creating ideal conditions for SMS-based services

### Our Solution
A comprehensive SMS-based financial platform that combines:
- **ICP's reverse gas model** - eliminating transaction fees for end users
- **Threshold signature security** - multi-layered protection against fraud
- **Agent network integration** - leveraging existing cash-out infrastructure
- **Local language support** - Luganda and Swahili interfaces

## üöÄ Getting Started
