# AfriTokeni MVP

SMS-based financial system built on Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for Uganda's unbanked population.

## Overview

AfriTokeni provides banking services via SMS for feature phones and web interface for smartphones, targeting Uganda's 14.6M unbanked adults with 83% lower costs than traditional mobile money.

## üß≠ Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** This app requires Juno's local development environment for ICP authentication to work.

### 1. Start the Juno development emulator (REQUIRED)

**You MUST run this first** - the ICP authentication will not work without it:

```bash
juno dev start
```

This starts the local ICP blockchain emulator and Internet Identity service at `localhost:8000`.

### 2. Create a Satellite

Your project needs a Satellite. Create one to connect your app for development.

üëâ [Open the Juno Console](http://localhost:5866)

### 3. Configure your project

Set the Satellite ID in your `juno.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      development: "<DEV_SATELLITE_ID>",
    },
    source: "dist",
    predeploy: ["npm run build"],
  },
});
```

### 4. Start the frontend dev server

In another terminal, start your app's dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Create required Datastore collections

AfriTokeni needs these collections in the Datastore:
- `users` - User profiles and authentication data
- `transactions` - Transaction history
- `balances` - User account balances

üëâ [Go to Datastore](http://localhost:5866/datastore)

### 6. Test the application

- **Web Authentication**: Click "Sign in with Internet Identity" on the landing page
- **SMS Banking**: Use the "üì± Access SMS Banking" for feature phone simulation

**Note**: Make sure `juno dev start` is running or authentication will fail with connection errors.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Production

Ready to go live?

Just like for local development, you'll need to create a Satellite ‚Äî but this time on the mainnet [Console](https://console.juno.build). Then, update your `juno.config.ts` with the new Satellite ID:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      development: "<DEV_SATELLITE_ID>",
      production: "<PROD_SATELLITE_ID>",
    },
    source: "dist",
    predeploy: ["npm run build"],
  },
});
```
