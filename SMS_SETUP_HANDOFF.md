# SMS Integration Setup - Handoff Instructions

## 🎯 What's Done:
✅ Complete SMS/USSD infrastructure built  
✅ Pan-African phone number support (8 countries with full SMS+USSD, 31+ with SMS)  
✅ All SMS commands implemented (REG, BAL, SEND, BTC, WITHDRAW, etc.)  
✅ USSD menu system (*123#) ready  
✅ Real backend integration with Juno/ICP  
✅ Multi-currency support (auto-detects from phone number)  
✅ Landing page updated with accurate country info  

## 🚧 What's Left to Complete:

### 1. Africa's Talking Account Setup (30 minutes)

**Current Status:**
- Account created: ✅
- Username: `sandbox`
- API Key: Already in `.env` file
- Account NOT fully activated yet ⚠️

**What You Need to Do:**

#### Step 1: Activate Account
1. Go to: https://account.africastalking.com/apps/sandbox
2. Click **"Launch Simulator"** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"Add Phone Number"**
4. Add a test number (e.g., +2348153353131 or your own)
5. Verify the number with the code they send

#### Step 2: Get Shortcode
1. In dashboard, note your SMS shortcode (usually `22948` for sandbox)
2. For USSD, you'll get assigned a code like `*384*96#`
3. Update `.env` if different:
   ```bash
   AT_SHORT_CODE=your_actual_shortcode
   ```

### 2. Setup ngrok for Webhooks (15 minutes)

**Why Needed:**
Africa's Talking needs to send incoming SMS to your server. Your server is on `localhost:3002` which they can't reach. ngrok creates a public URL.

**Steps:**

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Start SMS server (Terminal 1)
npm run dev:sms

# Expose it publicly (Terminal 2)
ngrok http 3002
```

**You'll get a URL like:** `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

**Configure in Africa's Talking:**
1. Go to: SMS → Settings → Callback URL
2. Set: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/sms/incoming`
3. For USSD: Set `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/ussd/callback`

### 3. Test SMS Flow (10 minutes)

**Once webhooks are configured:**

1. Send SMS from your phone to shortcode (e.g., `22948`):
   ```
   REG John Doe
   ```

2. You should receive reply:
   ```
   Welcome to AfriTokeni, John Doe! Your account is ready.
   ```

3. Test other commands:
   ```
   BAL
   BTC BAL
   BTC RATE NGN
   HELP
   ```

### 4. Test USSD Menu (5 minutes)

1. Dial your USSD code on phone: `*384*96#` (or whatever they assigned)
2. Interactive menu should appear
3. Navigate with numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)

## 🐛 Known Issues to Fix:

### Issue 1: "Try SMS Banking" Link Broken
**Problem:** The landing page has a "Try SMS Banking →" link that goes to `/sms` route, but we deleted the SMS simulation components.

**Fix Options:**
- **Option A:** Remove the link entirely (SMS is now real, no simulation)
- **Option B:** Point it to documentation/help page
- **Option C:** Create a simple "How to Use SMS" page

**Quick Fix (Option A):**
```typescript
// In src/pages/LandingPage.tsx, remove or comment out:
<Link to="/sms" className="...">
  Try SMS Banking →
</Link>

// Replace with:
<a href="https://docs.afritokeni.com/sms" className="...">
  SMS Documentation →
</a>
```

### Issue 2: Some TypeScript Warnings
**Non-critical warnings in:**
- `smsCommandProcessor.ts` - unused variables
- `ussdService.ts` - unused variables
- `smsServer.ts` - unused parameters

**These don't block functionality, can be cleaned up later.**
