# AfriTokeni Revenue Model & Business Viability

## üéØ Executive Summary

AfriTokeni generates **real revenue** through 4 concrete streams, NOT through theoretical accounting of transaction fee splits. This document clarifies how the platform actually makes money.

---

## üí∞ Real Revenue Streams

### **1. Agent Settlement Fees** (Primary Revenue - 40% of total)

**What it is**: When agents withdraw their earned commissions to their bank accounts or mobile money.

**How it works**:
```
Agent earns commissions: 1,000,000 UGX
Agent requests settlement (withdrawal)
Platform charges: 2% settlement fee = 20,000 UGX
Agent receives: 980,000 UGX (real bank transfer)
Platform keeps: 20,000 UGX (REAL MONEY in platform bank account)
```

**Revenue calculation**:
- Average agent earnings: 500,000 UGX/month
- Settlement frequency: 2x per month
- Settlement fee: 2%
- Revenue per agent: 20,000 UGX/month
- 1,000 agents = 20,000,000 UGX/month (~$5,400 USD)

**Implementation status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Settlement fee currently shows "Free" in UI
- No fee deduction in settlement processing
- No platform revenue capture

**What needs to be built**:
- Add 2% fee calculation in `AgentSettlement.tsx`
- Create `platform_revenue` collection in Juno
- Record real revenue on each settlement
- Update agent balance after fee deduction

### **2. Agent Liquidity Fees** (Secondary Revenue - 25% of total)

**What it is**: When agents deposit money to fund their operational digitalBalance.

**How it works**:
```
Agent needs to fund operations: 5,000,000 UGX
Agent deposits via bank transfer/mobile money
Platform charges: 1% funding fee = 50,000 UGX
Agent receives: 4,950,000 UGX digitalBalance
Platform keeps: 50,000 UGX (REAL MONEY)
```

**Revenue calculation**:
- Average funding: 2,000,000 UGX per agent
- Funding frequency: 1x per month
- Funding fee: 1%
- Revenue per agent: 20,000 UGX/month
- 1,000 agents = 20,000,000 UGX/month (~$5,400 USD)

**Implementation status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Funding currently shows "Free for bank transfers"
- No fee deduction in funding processing
- No platform revenue capture

**What needs to be built**:
- Add 1% fee calculation in `AgentFunding.tsx`
- Deduct fee from funded amount
- Record platform revenue
- Show fee breakdown to agent before confirmation

---

### **3. Bitcoin Exchange Spread** (High-Margin Revenue - 20% of total)

**What it is**: Platform markup on Bitcoin buy/sell transactions.

**How it works**:
```
Market BTC price: $45,000
Platform buys at: $45,000 (from exchange)
Platform sells to user at: $45,450 (1% markup)
User pays: $45,450
Platform profit: $450 (REAL MONEY)
```

**Revenue calculation**:
- Average Bitcoin transaction: $500
- Spread: 1%
- Revenue per transaction: $5
- 1,000 transactions/month = $5,000/month

**Implementation status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Bitcoin service exists
- No spread calculation in pricing
- Uses market rate directly (no markup)

**What needs to be built**:
- Add 1% spread to `BitcoinService.getExchangeRate()`
- Show "Platform rate" vs "Market rate" to users
- Calculate and record spread profit
- Implement buy/sell rate difference

---

### **4. Monthly Agent Subscription** (Recurring Revenue - 15% of total)

**What it is**: Monthly platform fee for active agents.

**How it works**:
```
Active agent fee: 50,000 UGX/month (~$13.50 USD)
Charged automatically on 1st of each month
Agent must maintain active status to process transactions
```

**Revenue calculation**:
- Fee per agent: 50,000 UGX/month
- 1,000 active agents = 50,000,000 UGX/month (~$13,500 USD)

**Implementation status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- No subscription system
- No monthly billing
- Agents operate for free

**What needs to be built**:
- Create subscription management system
- Implement monthly billing cycle
- Auto-deduct from agent balance
- Suspend inactive agents who don't pay

---

## üìä Transaction Fee Split (70/30) - NOT REAL REVENUE

### **Current Implementation**

On every transaction, dynamic fees are calculated:
```typescript
// dynamicFeeService.ts
Total fee: 2.8% (on 100,000 UGX = 2,800 UGX)
Agent commission: 70% = 1,960 UGX ‚Üí Added to agent.cashBalance
Platform share: 30% = 840 UGX ‚Üí NOWHERE (just calculated, not stored)
```

### **Why This is NOT Real Revenue**

The platform doesn't actually "get" the 30% because:

1. **No money changes hands**: It's just database numbers
2. **Agent already has the cash**: User gave physical cash to agent
3. **Platform has no bank account involved**: No real money transfer
4. **It's accounting only**: Used for metrics and analytics

### **What the 30% Actually Represents**

It's a **theoretical platform share** used for:
- Business analytics
- Understanding total fees collected
- Agent performance metrics
- NOT actual money in platform bank account

### **Implementation**

The 30% should be tracked for analytics:
```typescript
// platform_metrics collection (analytics only)
{
  month: 'October 2025',
  totalTransactionVolume: 50_000_000,
  totalFeesCharged: 1_500_000,
  agentCommissionsPaid: 1_050_000, // 70%
  platformTheoreticalShare: 450_000, // 30% (NOT REAL MONEY)
  realRevenueFromSettlement: 50_000, // ACTUAL MONEY
  realRevenueFromLiquidity: 30_000, // ACTUAL MONEY
  realRevenueFromBitcoin: 20_000, // ACTUAL MONEY
  realRevenueFromSubscriptions: 13_500 // ACTUAL MONEY
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

1. **The 30% transaction fee split is NOT real revenue** - it's accounting only
2. **Real revenue comes from 4 concrete streams** - settlement, liquidity, Bitcoin, subscriptions
3. **All revenue must be captured in real bank accounts** - not just Juno database numbers
4. **Platform viability depends on implementing these revenue streams** - currently NOT implemented
5. **Without real revenue capture, AfriTokeni cannot sustain operations** - this is critical business logic

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Review and approve this revenue model** with stakeholders
2. **Prioritize implementation** of the 4 revenue streams
3. **Set up platform bank accounts** for real money capture
4. **Implement Phase 1 (Settlement Fees)** as proof of concept
5. **Monitor and iterate** based on real-world data
