# Lightning Network Integration - Week 2 Complete ⚡

## Overview
Successfully integrated Lightning Network functionality with the new SMS/USSD infrastructure from the main branch merge. The system now supports instant Bitcoin transfers via both web interface and SMS commands with no internet required.

## Integration Points

### 1. SMS Command Processor (`smsCommandProcessor.ts`)
**Added Lightning Commands:**
- `LN` / `LIGHTNING` - Show Lightning Network info and help
- `LN SEND [phone] [amount] [currency]` - Send instant Lightning payment
- `LN INVOICE [amount] [currency]` - Create Lightning invoice for receiving
- `LN PAY [invoice]` - Pay a Lightning invoice

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Lightning Network commands
if (normalizedMessage === 'LN' || normalizedMessage === 'LIGHTNING') {
  const response = await SMSLightningCommands.processCommand({
    command: 'LN',
    phoneNumber,
    params: [],
  });
  return { success: response.success, reply: response.message };
}
```

### 2. USSD Service (`ussdService.ts`)
**Added Lightning Menu:**
- Main menu option 5: "Lightning Network ⚡"
- Interactive menu flow for Lightning operations
- Multi-step forms for sending and receiving Lightning payments

**Menu Structure:**
```
5. Lightning Network ⚡
  ├── 1. Send Lightning Payment
  │   ├── Enter recipient phone
  │   ├── Enter amount
  │   ├── Select currency (NGN/KES/UGX/ZAR)
  │   └── Execute transfer
  ├── 2. Create Invoice
  │   ├── Enter amount
  │   ├── Select currency
  │   └── Generate invoice
  └── 3. Lightning Info
```

### 3. SMS UI Component (`SMSUI.tsx`)
**Added Demo Commands:**
- `LN` - Lightning Network information
- `LN SEND +256701234567 5000 UGX` - Instant Lightning send demo
- `LN INVOICE 10000 UGX` - Lightning invoice creation demo

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Yellow/gold color scheme for Lightning commands (distinct from orange Bitcoin)
- Lightning bolt emoji (⚡) for visual identification
- Quick command buttons with Lightning category
- Educational info box explaining Lightning benefits

## Core Services

### Lightning Service (`lightningService.ts`)
**Features:**
- OpenNode API integration for production
- Mock invoice generation for development
- Lightning invoice creation and payment
- QR code generation for invoices
- Payment status tracking
- Network statistics

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
createInvoice(data: { amount, currency, description, userId })
payInvoice(invoice: string, userId: string)
sendToUser(data: { fromUserId, toUserId, amount, currency })
decodeInvoice(invoice: string)
checkPaymentStatus(paymentId: string)
calculateLightningFee(amountSats: number)
getNetworkStats()
```

### Bitcoin Routing Service (`bitcoinRoutingService.ts`)
**Intelligent Routing:**
- Automatic routing between Lightning and on-chain based on amount
- Lightning for transactions < $50 (instant, ~$0.001 fee)
- On-chain for transactions > $50 (secure, higher fees)
- Dust limit protection (minimum $0.01)

**Decision Logic:**
```typescript
if (amountUSD < LIGHTNING_MIN_USD) → on-chain (too small)
if (amountUSD < LIGHTNING_MAX_USD) → Lightning (optimal)
if (amountUSD > LIGHTNING_MAX_USD) → on-chain (security)
```

### SMS Lightning Commands (`smsLightningCommands.ts`)
**Command Processing:**
- `LN` - Network info with stats
- `LN SEND` - Instant Lightning payment with routing check
- `LN INVOICE` - Create Lightning invoice with expiry
- `LN PAY` - Pay Lightning invoice with fee calculation

**Response Format:**
```

## USSD Flow Examples

### Lightning Send via USSD
```
*123# → 5 (Lightning Network)
→ 1 (Send Lightning Payment)
→ +256701234567 (recipient)
→ 5000 (amount)
→ 3 (UGX currency)
→ ⚡ INSTANT Transfer Complete!
```

### Lightning Invoice via USSD
```
*123# → 5 (Lightning Network)
→ 2 (Create Invoice)
→ 10000 (amount)
→ 3 (UGX currency)
→ Invoice created with payment request
```
